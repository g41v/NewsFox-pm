# NewsFox
NewsFox is an efficient 3-pane (email) style Atom/RSS feed reader. NewsFox allows you to group your feeds as you wish, read feed content offline, update feeds when you want, 1-click subscribe with the [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/) URL bar icon, and read other feeds while updating.

# Note
This is a continuation of the [NewsFox add-on](https://web.archive.org/web/20191031211347/http://newsfox.mozdev.org/) for the old FireFox browser started and maintained over the years by Andrey Gromyko (developer), Ron Pruitt (developer) & Andy Frank (project creator) after obtaining permission from Andrey Gromyko and Ron Pruitt, unfortunately all attempts to contact Andy Frank ware unsuccessful.

**Please do not try to contact the original team** about bugs and problems, use the Issues tab and keep in mind that I'm an amateur trying to keep this add-on alive and useful in my free time and with very limited skills.
Pull requests are welcomed if you are willing to contribute to the project.
