# NewsFox
NewsFox is an efficient 3-pane (email) style Atom/RSS feed reader. NewsFox allows you to group your feeds as you wish, read feed content offline, update feeds when you want, 1-click subscribe with the Pale Moon URL bar icon, and read other feeds while updating.

# Note
This is a continuation of the old FireFox add-on for started by Andrey Gromyko (project owner), Ron Pruitt (developer) & Andy Frank (project creator) after obtaining permission from the team.
Please do not try to contact the original team about bugs and issues, use the Issues tab and keep in mind that Iâ€™m an amateur trying to keep this add-on alive and useful in my free time and with limited skills.
Pull requests are welcomed if you are willing to contribute to the project.
